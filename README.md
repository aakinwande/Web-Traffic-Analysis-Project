# Web Traffic Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing web traffic data to derive insights using Python for data manipulation and analysis, and Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation. The dataset used contains information on daily unique visitors, device categories, browsers, and bounce rates.


# Tools Used
1. Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy for data manipulation, analysis, and initial visualization.<br />
2. Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations


# Project Steps
1. Data Preparation and Analysis (Python)<br />
Data Loading: Load the dataset into Python using Pandas.<br />
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Handle missing data, convert data types, and create derived metrics if necessary.<br />
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze daily unique visitors, traffic by device category and browser, and bounce rates over time using Matplotlib for initial visualizations.<br /><br />
2. Visualization and Dashboard Creation (Power BI)<br />
Data Import: Import cleaned and preprocessed data into Power BI Desktop.<br />
Visualization Creation: Create line charts for daily unique visitors, bar charts for device categories and browsers, and a line chart for bounce rates.<br />
Dashboard Design: Design an interactive dashboard with slicers and filters for exploring data by date range, device category, and browser.<br />
Publishing: Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing and embedding.


# Usage
1. Data Analysis: Use Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to analyze and visualize the dataset.<br />
2. Dashboard Exploration: Open Power BI Desktop and load .pbix files from reports/ to interact with the pre-built dashboards.<br />
